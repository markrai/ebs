  	<bean id="myCoach"

 Special Note about init and destroy Method Signatures when using XML configuration:

	Access modifier
	The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)

	Return type
	The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.

	Method name
	The method can have any method name.

	Arguments
	The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The preferred way is to use method annotations, like so:

@PostConstruct
@PreDestroy
