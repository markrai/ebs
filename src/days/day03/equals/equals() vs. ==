equals() and == 


Quick Answer:
				==        is for reference/memory address comparison.

				
				equals()  is for content comparison depending on how it is defined.
				          this method must be overridden to be of any use. By default
				          this method only does a shallow comparison.


Shallow comparison: The default implementation of equals method is defined in 
                    Java.lang.Object class which simply checks if two Object references
                    (say x and y) refer to the same Object. i.e. It checks if x == y. 
                    Since Object class has no data members that define its state, 
                    it is also known as shallow comparison.

Deep Comparison:    Suppose a class provides its own implementation of equals() method 
                    in order to compare the Objects of that class w.r.t state of the Objects.
                    That means data members (i.e. fields) of Objects are to be compared with one another.
                    Such Comparison based on data members is known as deep comparison.
