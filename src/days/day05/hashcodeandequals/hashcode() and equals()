Simply put, hashCode() returns an integer value, generated by a hashing algorithm.
Objects that are equal (according to their equals() method) must return the same hash code.
It's not required for different objects to return different hash codes.


The "hashCode()" and "equals()" contract:

These are both methods of the Object class:

.equals() - used to verify the equality of two objects.
		   by default, two objects are equal if they are stored in the same
		   memory address.

.hashCode() - returns a hashCode value (int) for the object.


The equals and hashcode contract: Equal objects must have equal hashcodes.
As a best practice, you must always override hashCode when you override equals.
