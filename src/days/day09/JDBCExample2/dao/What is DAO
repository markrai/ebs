o WHAT IS A DAO? (Data Access Object)

 o Provides abstraction between JDBC and the rest of the code.
 o It should encapsulate the logic for retrieving, saving and updating data in your
   data storage. 
 o Often leverages a common interface.
 o Concrete implementation reacts on single data domain.
 o Encapsulation of complex joins and aggregations.

o DAO Factory
	o Often used with DAOs
	o Provides ability to leverage common paths for basic CRUD operations.
	o Loses value when you have a lot of custom methods.

o WHAT IS A DTO? (Data Transfer Object)

  o It is used to transfer the data between classes and modules of your application.
  o Should fully encapsulate objects and/or contain sub-objects.
  o A DTO should be the input or output of a single DAO.

  see: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html  

o Together, the DTO/DAO acts as the MODEL in your MVC application.
