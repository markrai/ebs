Problem:

We need to be able to sort a collection using the Collection.sort() method.

BUT!

sort() only accepts those objects which are Comparable.


What does that mean?

It means that the class of these objects must implement the Comparable interface:

e.g. Comparable<Laptop>

and then it must implement the CompareTo() method.


// this > obj  +1
// this < obj  -1
// this = obj   0
