Consider the Laptop class in this package.

When we have to write the logic for the comparison 
of a class OUTSIDE the class, we use a Comparator object
in the Runner class.

i.e. when our class is not implementing the Comparable interface.

When might this happen? 

When we are not allowed to change the class's functionality.
