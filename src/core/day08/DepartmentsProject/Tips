Improvements and considerations:

1. Use a mocking framework such as Mockito
2. Use jUnit tests
3. Create model (DB schema first)
4. Use recursion to determine multi-level allocations.
5. Considering using Spring for this project.
6. Do use JPA to communicate with database
7. Use a configuration file to edit salaries, etc instead of hardcoding them.
