Java's Collection Interfaces:

Set: Does not allow duplicates.
List: Duplicates Allowed. Ordered Elements.
Queue: Typically order elements in FIFO order. (except Priority Queue)
	Deque: Elements can be inserted & removed at both ends. LIFO & FIFO.


Map: KV pairs. Doesn't allow duplicates. Map is technically not part of the collection interface.
