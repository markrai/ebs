The "hashCode()" and "equals()" contract:

These are both methods of the Object class:

.equals() - used to verify the equality of two objects.
		   by default, two objects are equal if they are stored in the same
		   memory address.

.hashCode() - returns a hashCode value (int) for the object.


The equals and hashcode contract: Equal objects must have equal hashcodes.
As a best practice, you must always override hashCode when you override equals.
