Java does not allow you to inherit from multiple different classes.

i.e. you cannot do:

class Cat extends from Animal, Mammals;

Java does not support "multiple inheritance."
 
Diamond Inheritance Problem:

    A
   / \
  B   C
  \   /
    D
    
 If B and C inherit from A, and both B and C override a method which they inherited from class A....
 and then class D extends both class B and C.... which version of the method will class D have?
