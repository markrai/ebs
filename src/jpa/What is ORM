What is ORM (Object - Relational Mapping)

In a Relational Database, data is represented using tables with columns, and a unique
key identifying each row. The rows represent instances of that type of data.
Rows in a table can be linked to rows on another table by adding a column for the unique key
on the other table. This column is called a foreign key.

Object Oriented Programming Languages store data in objects and classes.


JPA is an abstraction on top of JDBC. It resides in the javax.persistence package.
JPA is simply a set of empty methods and "guidelines" and describes the Java persistence methodologies.

As of 2019, the instance providers for JPA are:

EclipseLink (Oracle)
Hibernate (JBoss & RedHat)
OpenJPA (IBM)
DataNucleus (JPOX)
